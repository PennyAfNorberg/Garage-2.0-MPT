# Garage-2.0-MPT
A projekt in a course, forked from the workplace.
Now you need to add a secret by 'manage user secrets' in solution explorer and that one needs

  "facebook": {
    "AppId": "<value>",
    "AppSecret": "<value>"
  },
  "From": {
    "Name": "<value>",
    "Address": "<value>"
  },
  "Smtp": {
    "Address": "<value>",
    "Port": <value>,
    "User": "<value>",
    "PassWord": "<value>"
  }
  leave User blank is not needed for smtp.
